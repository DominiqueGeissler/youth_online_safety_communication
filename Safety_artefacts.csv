Second, if you see warning screens placed on posts, we’ll ask you for your birthday before you can see the post. These screens aren’t new, and we already show them on posts that may be sensitive or graphic, but we don’t currently ask for your birthday when viewing these posts. Now, we’ll start asking for your birthday on some of these screens if you haven’t shared it with us previously.

We recognize some people may give us the wrong birthday, and we’re developing new systems to address this.

In the future, if someone tells us they’re above a certain age, and our technology tells us otherwise, we’ll show them a menu of options to verify their age. This work is still in the early stages, and we look forward to sharing more soon.

Artificial intelligence is the cornerstone of the approach we’re taking. We’ve developed technology that allows us to estimate people’s ages, like if someone is below or above 18. We train the technology using multiple signals. We look at things like people wishing you a happy birthday and the age written in those messages, for example, “Happy 21st Bday!” or “Happy Quinceañera.” We also look at the age you shared with us on Facebook and apply it to our other apps where you have linked your accounts and vice versa — so if you share your birthday with us on Facebook, we’ll use the same for your linked account on Instagram. This technology isn’t perfect, and we’re always working to improve it, but that’s why it’s important we use it alongside many other signals to understand people’s ages. "

We’re partnering with Yoti, a company that specializes in privacy-preserving ways to verify age.
Starting today, we’re testing new options for people on Instagram to verify their age, starting with people based in the US. If someone attempts to edit their date of birth on Instagram from under the age of 18 to 18 or over, we’ll require them to verify their age using one of three options: upload their ID, record a video selfie or ask mutual friends to verify their age. We’re testing this so we can make sure teens and adults are in the right experience for their age group. We are also partnering with Yoti, a company that specializes in online age verification, to help ensure people’s privacy.

In 2019, we began asking people to provide their age when signing up for Instagram. Since then, we’ve made this a requirement. Knowing people’s age allows us to provide appropriate experiences to different age groups, specifically teens."

While people overwhelmingly use DMs to share what they love with their friends, family or favorite creators, sextortion scammers may also use private messages to share or ask for intimate images. To help address this, we’ll soon start testing our new nudity protection feature in Instagram DMs, which blurs images detected as containing nudity and encourages people to think twice before sending nude images. This feature is designed not only to protect people from seeing unwanted nudity in their DMs, but also to protect them from scammers who may send nude images to trick people into sending their own images in return.

Nudity protection will be turned on by default for teens under 18 globally, and we’ll show a notification to adults encouraging them to turn it on.

When nudity protection is turned on, people sending images containing nudity will see a message reminding them to be cautious when sending sensitive photos, and that they can unsend these photos if they’ve changed their mind."

Last summer, we launched the Sensitive Content Control so people could choose how much or how little sensitive content to see in Explore from accounts they don’t follow. Today, we’re announcing updates to this control.

Starting today, the Sensitive Content Control will cover all surfaces where we make recommendations. In addition to Explore, you will now be able to control the amount of sensitive content and accounts you see in Search, Reels, Accounts You Might Follow, Hashtag Pages and In-Feed Recommendations. With this update, we’re also applying the technology we use to enforce our Recommendation Guidelines to Instagram’s recommendations on Search and Hashtag pages. This update will be available to everyone in the coming weeks.

The Sensitive Content Control has three options, which we’ve renamed from when we first introduced the control to help explain what each option does. The three options are: “More”, “Standard” and “Less”.

“Standard” is the default state, and will prevent people from seeing some sensitive content and accounts. “More” enables people to see more sensitive content and accounts, whereas “Less” means they see less of this content than the default state. For people under the age of 18, the “More” option is unavailable.

We’ve developed technology that allows us to find adult accounts that have shown potentially suspicious behavior, such as adults who have recently been blocked or reported by a young person. We stop these adult accounts from interacting with teen accounts the following ways:
We don’t show teen accounts in Explore, Reels or ‘Accounts Suggested For You’ to these adults.
If these adults find young people’s accounts by searching for their usernames, they do not have the option to follow them.
These adults are not able to see teen accounts when scrolling through the list of people who have liked a certain post.
These adults are not able to see comments from teens on other people’s posts.
These adults are not able to see teen accounts when scrolling through an account’s Followers or Following list.
If these adults follow a teen account, we may send that teen a notification prompting them to review and remove the new follower.
If these adults are already connected to a teen account and send the teen a direct message, we send a safety notice to the teen encouraging them to be cautious and provide options to end the conversation, block, report, or restrict the adult.
Note: All of the above interventions also apply to teen accounts' ability to discover, search, view or interact with suspicious adult accounts."

We’ve also terminated hundreds of viewer accounts for the comments they left on videos and reported illegal behavior to the NCMEC so they can work with the proper authorities.

While the creators of these videos may have done nothing wrong, we’re going above and beyond our existing protections in the near term on content that may include or endanger minors. Our goal is to protect creators and the broader ecosystem while we improve our systems.

We’ve also taken some additional measures out of an abundance of caution:

Disabling comments 
We’ve disabled comments on tens of millions of videos that may include minors and therefore are at risk of predatory comments. As part of these actions, comments may be temporarily disabled on some or all of your videos.

We know comments are a key way creators connect with their community, but this was an important step for the safety of minors on YouTube and a precaution while we work to further improve our systems. We’re investing more in the tools we have to detect and remove this content.

If you are a parent or have minors in your videos please read our privacy & safety center and consider keeping your comments turned off.

If you do re-enable comments, you should hold and carefully review all new comments for approval before they're posted to your videos.


Limited Monetization
Videos that include minors and are at risk of predatory comments may receive limited or no ads (yellow icon). If you think we made a mistake please appeal. We’ll continue to refine our approach in the coming weeks and months.

Additionally, if you see any type of content (videos, comments, etc.) that you think exploits minors, please flag it for review and select “child abuse” in the reporting tool. No form of content that endangers minors is acceptable to us.

We’re taking swift action to ensure we’re identifying as much of this content as possible and will continue to take additional actions over the coming days and weeks to keep minors and the creator ecosystem safe. We will keep you posted as these changes occur."

Wherever we can, we want to stop young people from hearing from adults they don’t know, or that they don’t want to hear from.

So starting this week, everyone who is under 16 years old (or under 18 in certain countries) will be defaulted into a private account when they join Instagram.

Private accounts let people control who sees or responds to their content. If you have a private account, people have to follow you to see your posts, Stories and Reels unless you choose to allow others to reshare your content. People also can’t comment on your content in those places, and they won’t see your content at all in places like Explore or hashtags."

Encouraging young people to have private accounts is a big step in the right direction when it comes to stopping unwanted contact from adults. But we’re going even further to make young people’s accounts difficult to find for certain adults.

We’ve developed new technology that will allow us to find accounts that have shown potentially suspicious behavior and stop those accounts from interacting with young people’s accounts. By “potentially suspicious behavior”, we mean accounts belonging to adults that may have recently been blocked or reported by a young person for example.

Using this technology, now we won’t show young people’s accounts in Explore, Reels or ‘Accounts Suggested For You’ to these adults. If they find young people’s accounts by searching for their usernames, they won’t be able to follow them.

Snapchatters even have the option to turn off replies all together, or to block various terms to help them keep interactions respectful and fun. These Story replies from those who follow them are kept completely separate from Snapchatters' private conversations in their chat feed, and we have additional protections to help prevent content shared publicly from being a vector for unwanted friend requests from adults outside of a teens real friend network.  Limited distribution: Public Stories from 16- and 17-year olds will only be recommended to Snapchatters who are already their friends or followers, and to other Snapchatters with whom they share mutual friends. These public Stories are not distributed to the wider community in “Discover,” the section of our app where Snapchatters find a personalized viewing experience with content that’s relevant for them.

We want to give younger users the tools they need to understand their use of technology. In addition to our suite of digital well-being tools, we’ll be turning take a break and bedtime reminders on by default for all users ages 13-17 on YouTube. We’ll also be turning autoplay off by default for these users. If a user decides these aren’t the right digital well-being features for them, they can change their default settings.  """
